                <li><b>Details</b>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Appearance</u> :: Sharp, elegant, dapper. Wears a dark suit-vest like <a href="http://www.hikoreanfashion.com/13926-thickbox_default/black-double-layered-chain-suit-vests.jpg">this</a> or <a href="http://dallasvintageshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Photo-Aug-18-6-51-25-PM-668x1024.jpg">this</a>, worn from travel but kept in fine condition. Underneath he wears a striped shirt, also stained with travel (no tie?). Loose fitting pants similar to <a href="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/cc/9e/ba/cc9eba8f0ad7c3e74915bb301e9e60b7.jpg">this</a> or <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/b4/CourierDusterYesMan.png/revision/latest?cb=20110925232345">this</a>. Wears elegant, straightforward  boots/shoes, similar to <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coolmenshoes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F05%2F11%2F0%2FTod-s-No_Code-Men-s-Suede-Desert-Boots-5-1.jpg&f=1">these</a>. At his hip is a rapier, of impeccable craftsmanship and an otherworldly silver gleam. A chain is visible, leading to some pocket where a locket lies. He is naturally fair-skinned, perhaps a little tanned, but long travels have tanned and roughed his skin. His face is squarish, with a strong jaw hidden behind a thick, salt and pepper stubble. He seems to have a fatherly, contented half-smile on his face at all times. His eyes are a bright blue, sparked full of life, framing a chunky nose with a high bridge. His receding hair, black and gray, is cropped short and combed to the side.</li>
                    <li><u>Personality</u> :: Immediately charismatic, soft-spoken, very comforting fatherly voice. Very tactical and manipulative, knows how to treat people to get what he wants and needs, and always has in his sight the "big picture," allowing him to make intelligent decisions to stay one step ahead.</li>
                    <li><u>Motiviations</u> :: To catalog as much knowledge as possible of `PLACE`, such that he may use their secrets (and perhaps their "assistance") in his quest to resurrect his son and wife. In time, his motives become corrupted with power and insanity.</li>
                    <li><u>Weapon of choice</u> :: Rapier</li>
                    <li><u>Memento</u> :: Locket?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
