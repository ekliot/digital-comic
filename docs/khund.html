A pudgy face with deep-set brown eyes, decked with comically diminutive spectacles. Small, round nose and thin lips. He has two daggers, a longer straight blade and a short, curved [kerambit](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn2.bigcommerce.com%2Fserver3500%2F3gpq9l22%2Fproduct_images%2Fuploaded_images%2Fkbit-second5.jpg%3Ft%3D1394731078&f=1).
