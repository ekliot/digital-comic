                <ul>
                    <li><u>Appearance</u> :: Morbidly obese, wearing a just barely fitting snakeskin vest. with nothing underneath. His pants are loose and flowing. He is bald naught for the <a href="http://lasthairmodels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/queue-ponytail.gif">ponytail</a> behind his head and the long, thin whiskers of his chin. A pudgy face with deep-set brown eyes, decked with comically diminutive spectacles. Small, round nose and thin lips. He has two daggers, a longer straight blade and a short, curved <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn2.bigcommerce.com%2Fserver3500%2F3gpq9l22%2Fproduct_images%2Fuploaded_images%2Fkbit-second5.jpg%3Ft%3D1394731078&f=1">kerambit</a>. Carries a satchel loaded with books and scrolls. Significantly more lithe and agile than his size would suggest, uses his dynamic gravitism to his advantage in a fight, taking opponents by surprise.</li>
                    <li><u>Personality</u> :: Analytic, introverted. Tries not to get involved in irrelevant things, preferring to occupy himself with his studies, meditations, or appetite. Grows to be an academic and spiritual mentor to Sabah, as well as teaching him the important lesson of not judging a book by its cover (literally and figuratively). Has a soft spot for romantic fiction, gets very passionate about the art.</li>
                    <li><u>Motiviations</u> :: Very invested in the academic pursuit of the supernatural, to index new creatures and plants and to study inhuman tongues. Could never find love while he was holed up in his studies, so he's now turned to an adventuring life to try fill that hole in his life.</li>
                    <li><u>Weapon of choice</u> :: Dual daggers (straight and kerambit)</li>
                    <li><u>Memento</u> :: Spectacles? Romantic novel?</li>
