        <h1>Genesia</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Stats</b>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Age</u> :: Mid 20's</li>
                    <li><u>Gender</u> :: Female</li>
                    <li><u>Height</u> :: 6'1.5"</li>
                    <li><u>Weight</u> :: ~190 lbs</li>
                </ul>

                <li><b>Details</b>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Appearance</u> :: Tall, stocky, imposing. Her face is framed by a strong, tapered jawline. Her lips are thick but pale, crowned by an average sized pointed nose with a bent bridge. She has big eyes, pale blue. A scar runs down one cheek and across the corner of her mouth. Her tawny hair is cut short at the front and sides, while braided at the back. Her face is not usually seen, as it is hidden behind a helmet (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo_helmet">Sutton-Hoo</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog-mouth_helm">Frog mouth</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armet">Armet</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbute">Barbute</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_helm">Great helm</a>?). Clad in weathered cuirass, frayed chainmail from under the plate hangs over her shoulders. Bare muscled arms are adorned with wrist braces of studded leather. On her legs she wears tall greaves of scarred steel, padded with leather, with scaled thigh armour (<a href="http://www.darkknightarmoury.com/images/Product/large/DK5255.png">ref</a>). Her thighs are otherwise unprotected. Overall, she is a representation of an aggressive female sexuality. Over the course of their adventures, she begins fully armoured, then gradually loses, breaks, or otherwise forgoes parts of her armour, until she is entirely or almost-entirely unarmoured by the end, paralleling her familiarity/comfort with her own sexuality (a discomfort which deliberately contrasts her own physical bravado and overly self-assuredness). She is, at this stage in the comic's timeline, roughly halfway through her "metamorphosis".</li>
                    <li><u>Personality</u> :: Cocksure, aggressive, and boisterous. She is grit, power, and confidence all in one, in the flesh. She rarely gives time for contemplation, preferring to rush in and sort things out later (or not at all). Looks for any and all opportunities to exert herself, lusts after physical expression of all sorts. Compensating for some kind of repression...</li>
                    <li><u>Motiviations</u> :: Her arranged marriage partner was brutally murdered on the night before their wedding. As she was quite vocally unhappy with the engagement, desperately trying to become a knight, she was blamed for the murder and extradited. However, having picked up on the trail of some sort of involvement from `PLACE`, she's been doggedly pursuing those leads in search of the truth to prove herself as a knight and return home. How did she find out about this in the first place? Well, she got a little tip from a certain Markos...</li>
                    <li><u>Weapon of choice</u> :: Polearm? Greathammer? 2H sword? Or, shield + mace, sword, spear, or axe...</li>
                    <li><u>Memento</u> :: Family crest?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
