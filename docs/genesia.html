    <td>Dressing Room Cutaway</td>
    <td>
      <li>Cutaway view of a dressing room. Birds in sky through the window.</li>
      <li>Genesia is in a dress, visibly upset, having just put it on in front of a mirror.</li>
      <li>Sound waves/spikes coming from right border (the door)</li>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Bedroom Cutaway</td>
    <td>
      <li>Door opens from left border into this panel, Genesia has stepped through and looks in shock.</li>
      <li>Body of her fiancee is slumped against the bed, stabbed.</li>
      <li>Curch bell profiled in the window</li>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Hallway Cutaway</td>
    <td>
      <li>Genesia is backing away from guards with spears. She is still in the dress, two guards back her into the right border (a door opened into this panel)</li>
      <li>Set in a hallway, maybe a chandelier, or an open doorway on the back of the panel (showing a wedding altar)</li>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Armoury (hah) Cutaway</td>
    <td>
      <li>The door on the left side is barricaded (furniture leaned against it)</li>
      <li>Genesia is middle of the frame, strolling to a suit of armour on a pedestal, weapon leaned against it.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the armour is on a pedestal, or elevated somehow (like, the floor is raised a couple steps).</li>
      <li>Context clues from furniture out to tell the right side of this panel has no door (and no door in the background).</li>
      <li>Idea: dress crumpled on ground behind Genesia, she is reaching up to the armour, naked (twist torso so right arm is reaching up and chest is facing the background)</li>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Transition Panel?</dt>
    <td>
      <li>Perhaps, some kind of closeup-profile between the cutaway panels and the more landscape-y panel?</li>
      <li>If no undressing in last panel, show discarded dress somehow</li>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Profile</td>
    <td>
      <li>No more cutaway angle</li>
      <li>Genesia is fully clad, on a horse (non-armoured but big), riding down the cliff from her fiancee's castle</li>
      <li>Guards are lined on the walls, perhaps the king/queen/relevant parties are standing at the gate, shaking their fists (however, they are far away, and smaller and less detailed than Genesia, who should have the focus)</li>
      <li>A big sun is setting over the castle</li>
