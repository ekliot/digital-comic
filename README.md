# ENGL 318 Final Project

## Who

This is a collaboration project between Paolo Morgan Orso-Giacone and myself, Elijah Kliot.

## What

For this project, we will use a digital medium to express a story and its meaning, primarily through the use of parallax effects.

The story is centered on the main character, Sabah, of a yet-unnamed setting. Time has trickled past this weathered adventurer, and now he sits and recollects the stories of his once companions. Are they gone forever, passed on beyond the mortal plane, or merely lost among the countless acres of the earth? Regardless, Sabah is here, now, and his memories are certain fact...

## Why

Paolo and I have long since wanted to collaborate on a comic. We've played with this setting, a mix of Neil Gaiman's *Neverwhere* and Robert E Howard's *Hyboria*, where we wanted to chronicle an epic odyssey of a band of adventuring comrades, mortals faced with the darkness just behind the corner, an inhuman and eldritch second-world seeping into our own.

When we enrolled in a class at our university discussing the medium comics and graphic novels, and were offered the opportunity to create a comic of our own for the final project, it was not a question what we would create. This project lets us take a small snippet of our setting, to explore specific characters, and to combine our respective expertise into a project expressing a unique digital medium for comics.

## How

This project will utilize parallax effects and Paolo's paper cutout art to simulate depth and light effects inside a web browser. The expected technical tools will be javascript and an exacto blade.

The experience itself will center on a campfire, at which Sabah is seated. Around him are his comrades. Moving the mouse will dictate the parallax shifting, the mouse simulating a light source shining through the cutout image. Clicking on a character or a memento of theirs (undecided) will cause the campfire to kindle, sending the view upwards, where a vignette is played through comic panels, using a similar parallax effect. At the end of the vignette, the view shifts back to the campfire, where the observed character is now absent.

# Character Outlines

The characters to be explored. Names enclosed in {curly braces} are "codenames" and ought to be replaced with real names.

The descriptions of all characters are how they are at the time of their respective vignettes. Sabah is as he is in the moment of the campfire.

## Sabah

* __Stats__:
  * _Age_ :: Late 20's
  * _Gender_ :: Male
  * _Height_ :: 5'9"
  * _Weight_ :: ~170 lbs
* __Details__:
  * _Appearance_ :: Lean, weathered by desert travel. Olive-skinned, almond-shaped earthy green eyes. Pointed chin, unimposing hooked nose. High cheekbones. Sparse stubble. Small ears, close/flat against the head. Feathered and unevenly cropped black hair, roughly 3-5" in length, bangs swept aside and held in place with a thin circlet (is this circlet special?). Wearing an assortment of traditional furs and cloths. Generally a non-uniform impression. Light sandals, no gloves. Hands are bony, prominent knuckles, palms are calloused. Carries a sleeping roll, a pack with him containing various traveling supplies, a couple weapons and backups (what are these?).
  * _Personality_ :: Brash and foolhardy, eagle-eyed. Very perceptive of the world around him, can make astute and detailed observations of people and things happening around him. However, has a very shortsighted introspective view, and has great difficulty judging the consequences or weight of his actions. As a result, he tends to rush into situations, being very self-confident and observant of obstacles in his path, yet gets into trouble once his actions lead to unforeseen (to him) consequences.
  * _Motiviations_ :: Wants to learn of his parents' fate when he was an infant. This is also aligned with his desire to understand more of <PLACE>, which at this point he has learnt his father was intimately tied to. He is trying to follow through on how his father was involved, and how that led to him and his mother disappearing before he was picked up by clansmen. While initially he was repulsed and feared further involvement with the <PEOPLE>, since learning of his father's involvement he has become very active in pursuing their traces, on one hand to save others from his father's fate, but also because, given his nature, he has developed an intimate insight into their culture and being, and as such struggles with humanity's relationship with them, and Benito.

  * _Gender_ :: Male
  * _Height_ :: 5'10.5"
  * _Weight_ :: ~160 lbs
* __Details__:
  * _Appearance_ :: Sharp, elegant, dapper. Wears a dark suit-vest like [this](http://www.hikoreanfashion.com/13926-thickbox_default/black-double-layered-chain-suit-vests.jpg) or [this](http://dallasvintageshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Photo-Aug-18-6-51-25-PM-668x1024.jpg), worn from travel but kept in fine condition. Underneath he wears a striped shirt, also stained with travel. Loose fitting pants similar to [this](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/cc/9e/ba/cc9eba8f0ad7c3e74915bb301e9e60b7.jpg) or [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/b4/CourierDusterYesMan.png/revision/latest?cb=20110925232345). Wears elegant, straightforward  boots/shoes, similar to [these](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coolmenshoes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F05%2F11%2F0%2FTod-s-No_Code-Men-s-Suede-Desert-Boots-5-1.jpg&f=1). At his hip is a rapier, of impeccable craftsmanship and an otherworldly silver gleam. A chain is visible, leading to some pocket where a locket lies. He is naturally fair-skinned, perhaps a little tanned, but long travels have tanned and roughed his skin. His face is squarish, with a strong jaw hidden behind a thick, salt and pepper stubble. He seems to have a fatherly, contented half-smile on his face at all times. His eyes are a bright blue, sparked full of life, framing a chunky nose with a high bridge. His receding hair, black and gray, is cropped short and combed to the side.
  * _Personality_ :: Immediately charismatic, soft-spoken, very comforting fatherly voice. Very tactical and manipulative, knows how to treat people to get what he wants and needs, and always has in his sight the "big picture," allowing him to make intelligent decisions to stay one step ahead.
  * _Motiviations_ :: To catalog as much knowledge as possible of <PLACE>, such that he may use their secrets (and perhaps their "assistance") in his quest to resurrect his son and wife. In time, his motives become corrupted with power and insanity.
  * _Weapon of choice_ :: Rapier
  * _Memento_ :: Locket?
