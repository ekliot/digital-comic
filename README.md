# ENGL 318 Final Project

## Who

This is a collaboration project between Paolo Morgan Orso-Giacone and myself, Elijah Kliot.

## What

For this project, we will use a digital medium to express a story and its meaning, primarily through the use of parallax effects.

The story is centered on the main character, Sabah, of a yet-unnamed setting. Time has trickled past this weathered adventurer, and now he sits and recollects the stories of his once companions. Are they gone forever, passed on beyond the mortal plane, or merely lost among the countless acres of the earth? Regardless, Sabah is here, now, and his memories are certain fact...

## Why

Paolo and I have long since wanted to collaborate on a comic. We've played with this setting, a mix of Neil Gaiman's *Neverwhere* and Robert E Howard's *Hyboria*, where we wanted to chronicle an epic odyssey of a band of adventuring comrades, mortals faced with the darkness just behind the corner, an inhuman and eldritch second-world seeping into our own.

When we enrolled in a class at our university discussing the medium comics and graphic novels, and were offered the opportunity to create a comic of our own for the final project, it was not a question what we would create. This project lets us take a small snippet of our setting, to explore specific characters, and to combine our respective expertise into a project expressing a unique digital medium for comics.

## How

This project will utilize parallax effects and Paolo's paper cutout art to simulate depth and light effects inside a web browser. The expected technical tools will be javascript and an exacto blade.

The experience itself will center on a campfire, at which Sabah is seated. Around him are his comrades. Moving the mouse will dictate the parallax shifting, the mouse simulating a light source shining through the cutout image. Clicking on a character or a memento of theirs (undecided) will cause the campfire to kindle, sending the view upwards, where a vignette is played through comic panels, using a similar parallax effect. At the end of the vignette, the view shifts back to the campfire, where the observed character is now absent.

# Character Outlines

The characters to be explored. Names enclosed in {curly braces} are "codenames" and ought to be replaced with real names.

The descriptions of all characters are how they are at the time of their respective vignettes. Sabah is as he is in the moment of the campfire.
